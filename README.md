# PythonLanguageCards

This repository is for learning purposes only.

## Description

a simple GUI which helps you to memorize words in by you chosen foreign language (in this case English) and saves details thanks pandas in csv-format
1) GUI with images and widgets. Here you can upload your own images or customize the widgets as well. 
2) in shorter_content.csv are downloaded some english words with their czech translation.
3) after pressing the button "right" the word will stay in shorter_content.csv but will be removed from the list of words which should display for next time and will be included in a new created file "known_words.csv".
4) after pressing the button "wrong" which means that user did not know the word, the word will stay in the "to_learn" list and will appear again.
<br>Good luck!
